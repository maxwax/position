position
========

This is a personal script that I use in a Linux Gnome 3.x environment
to reposition and resize windows after switching displays.

Within Gnome 3.x I have .desktop files such as 
/usr/share/applications/work.desktop configured so I can tap the windows key
then type 'work' and have this script run.

Windows are repositioned and I don't have to spend time manually moving them
or launch a shell to run this script.

Unfortunately, there are always a large number of windows created during
each of my work sessions that have to be repositioned manually, but this
script takes windows that are always open: Evolution email, Chat client, and 
positioned them in a consistent manner
